A max delay constraint with -datapath_only has been applied between trimac_fifo_block/trimac_sup_block/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/inst/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_core/stats_block.statistics_counters/rd_data_ref_reg[71]/C and trimac_fifo_block/trimac_sup_block/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/inst/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_core/stats_block.statistics_counters/ip2bus_data_reg[2]/D. The startpoint(s) and endpoint(s) either belong to the same clock domain or belong to two clock domains that can safely be timed together (without valid synchronizer). It is only recommended to use the -datapath_only option on paths between clocks that do not have a known phase relationship. This DRC is waived when a synchronizer is found on the path endpoint
